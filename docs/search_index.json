Abstract: Human Investments Human Investments is an investment fund that focuses on people, both customers and employees, as a guide to forecasting a company’s success. For our next research endeavor, we will focus on employees and how their level of satisfaction foreshadows company success. We have two questions: 1) Do employee review scores on Glassdoor.com serve as a predictor for a company’s stock price? 2) If so, which review scores are the most important predictors? We believe that the eventual financial failures or successes of a company are broadcasted through employee satisfaction before those failures or successes come to the surface.

How many things did they sell last year and how many things will they sell next year? However, behind that success and profits (or lack thereof) is an often-overlooked catalyst…people! Human Investments is an investment fund that focuses on people, both customers and employees, as a guide to evaluating and forecasting a company’s success. For our next research endeavor, we will focus on employees and how their level of satisfaction foreshadows company success. Glassdoor.com allows employees anonymously write reviews about their companies (making the site a data gold mine for Human Investment’s strategy). The site captures employee review scores in culture, work/life balance, senior management, benefits, and career opportunities. This data is immensely valuable to companies to gauge their employee’s satisfaction. However, Human Investments believes there is just as great of value for investing. Modelling Employee Reviews and Stock Prices To gain a greater understanding of employee satisfaction’s effect on a company’s success, we are collaborating with Glassdoor.com to ask: Do employee review scores on Glassdoor.com serve as a predictor for a company’s stock price? If so, which review scores are the most important predictors? We will conduct this study for the time-period of 2011 through 2017 and will focus solely on insurance companies listed on the S&amp;P 500 to concentrate on a single industry. We will analyze Glassdoor-provided employee review data alongside openly available stock price data and Human Investment proprietary economic and financial data. This study presents many challenges, two of which are a) the issue of selection bias (do only disgruntled employees review?); and b) proving causality (do increasingly successful companies create happy employees or is it the other way around?). For our analysis, we will rely on our already created stock pricing models and develop advanced linear regression models, Bayesian networks, and neural networks to isolate and quantify the effect of employee satisfaction on a company’s success. Our hypothesis is that employee review scores serve as a predictor for a company’s stock price. We believe that the eventual financial failures or successes of a company are broadcasted through employee satisfaction before those failures or successes come to the surface. In the US, a knowledgeable employee is forbidden from sharing certain company secrets (insider trading). Our hypothesis is that, in aggregate, employee reviews reveal valuable company secrets and are, in a way, insider traded information which can be leveraged to make intelligent investments. The Internal and External Impact Pending on the findings, we will integrate the study’s results into our investment model and would expect to see added returns to our portfolio. Furthermore, we pledge to make our findings public. Human Investments believes in the importance of people and we hope to convince others that treating your employees well is important. Isolating the effect of employee satisfaction will have its many challenges, but if we can overcome these challenges we believe the results could have a beneficial impact on both our fund’s return and employees in the US. If the results of this study find that employee satisfaction causes company success, companies will hopefully be more incentivized to treat their employees better and Human Investments can profit along the way!

["genius-gambler-the-nightmare-of-vegas.html", "2 Genius Gambler {the nightmare of vegas} Why bring machine learning to Las Vegas? How does the model work? How did we do?", " 2 Genius Gambler {the nightmare of vegas} Keywords basketball, gambling, NBA, Las Vegas Why bring machine learning to Las Vegas? When it comes to gambling in basketball, casinos in Las Vegas expect people to be emotional. They expect people to make unwise decisions based on emotion, ignorance, and arrogance. Their entire business model revolves around offering bets to an uninformed and irrational public. Gambling’s structure and reputation has kept (most) smart people away. “Smart” people don’t gamble because they recognize the risk-to-reward ratio is uninspiring and their chances of winning over time are low. Genius Gambler brings smart people, or rather smart algorithms and models, to the world of basketball betting. How does the model work? Genius Gambler implements the latest machine learning algorithms used at Google, Facebook, and Uber to isolate the most promising (i.e., underpriced) bets concerning NBA games and players. The steps of the model are: Gather the data: Genius Gambler relies on a wide variety of publicly available and privately sold data. We gather all types of standard player and team statistics, including advanced statistics (which are themselves complicated models). Genius Gambler also uses a variety of team-centric data, such as team schedules, stadium success, and the amount of travel time between games. Additionally, Genius Gambler analyzes the internet for a variety of helpful insights, such as breaking news, twitter feeds, and online predictions by reputable sources. Model team/player success: This “Success Model” uses machine learning techniques to predict the success (or lack thereof) of teams and players in the NBA. The Success Model is trained on the diverse forms of collected data discussed above. The model predicts a wide variety of common basketball statistics, such as the likelihood of a team to win a given game (and by how many points) or the amount of rebounds a given player will get during a season. Most importantly, the success model provides a probability distribution for these statistics. These predictions are modeled independently of bets offered by the casinos. Identify bets and gamble: Genius Gambler uses the results of the Success Model discussed above to place a value on all bets offered by mainstream Las Vegas casinos. In this final stage, we identify underpriced bets, combinations of underpriced bets (parlays), and arbitrage opportunities. Our model then determines, given our level of capital, the appropriate amount to gamble on a given underpriced bet. How did we do? Last year, Genius Gambler started the season with $100,000 in capital and ended the season with just over $160,000 (60% return on investment). We outperformed most hedge funds by a significant margin. In total, we made 1,423 bets at an average price of $86.29 per bet. Our earnings were slightly skewed towards large earnings on low odds bets, as 60% of our profit came from 25% of our bets. Most of our losses came towards the end of the season as our model failed to recognize the general “wear and tear” on older players. Additionally, we learned that games in the NBA Finals are too volatile to model with any great accuracy. As Genius Gambler is built with a machine learning framework, our algorithms will improve from last year and we expect even greater returns this year and into the future! "]
