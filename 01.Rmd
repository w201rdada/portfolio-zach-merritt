#### Keywords

Genius Gambler brings machine learning to the world of basketball betting.

## A beginning.

When it comes to gambling in basketball, Las Vegas expects people to be emotional. They expect people to make unwise decisions based on emotion, ignorance, and arrogance. Gambling's structure and reputation has kept (most) smart people away. "Smart" people don't gamble because it is looked down upon and/or they recognize the risk-to-reward ratio is uninspiring and their chances of winning overtime is low. Vegas loves offering bets to an uninformed and emotional public. Genius Gambler brings smart people, or rather smart algorithms, to the world of basketball betting. 

## A middle.

Genius Gambler implements the latest machine learning algorithms used at Google, Facebook, and Uber to isolate the most promising bets concerning NBA games and players.  Genius Gambler does not bet on NCAA games (if the players can't make money than neither will we). Genius Gambler searches all bets offered by mainstream Las Vegas casinos for miscalculated lines, arbitrage opportunities, and promising parlays. Genius Gambler relies on separate algorithms for separate tasks and a combination of these algorithms for other tasks. For example, the "player algorithm" analyzes individual player performance (e.g., points scored in each game). The "single game algorithm" analyzes team performance on a given night (e.g., winning a game). The "bet algorithm" isolates promising bets.  Each of these algorithms feed a variety of models used to make gambling decisions.  

Genius Gambler relies on a wide variety of publicly available and privately sold data. Genius Gambler factors in all types of standard player and team statistics, including advanced statistics (which are themselves complicated models). We use a variety of team-centric data, such as team schedules, stadium success, and amount of travel time between games. Additionally, Genius Gambler analyzes the internet for a variety of helpful insights, such as breaking news, twitter feeds, and online predictions by reputable sources. 


## An end.

Last year, Genius Gambler started the season with $100,000 in capital and ended the season with $160,000 (60% return on investment). We outperformed most hedge funds by a significant margin. Most of our losses came towards the end of the season as our model failed to recognize the general "wear and tear" on older players. Additionally, we learned that the NBA finals is too volatile to model with any great accuracy. As Genius Gambler is built with a machine learning framework, our algorithms will improve from last year and we expect even greater returns this year and into the future!
